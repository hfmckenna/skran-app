# Recipe App (Skran)

## Goal

Make it easier to read recipes and find inspiration in every ingredients.

## Detail

Create a database of recipes that include no more than 12 ingredients, grouped into no more than 4 "components" of the meal. Cooking instructions are ideally a single word instruction, the component names can also be constructive.

The ingredients will come from a defined list and users can search by entering a single core ingredient, then choosing from a list of ingredients included in matching recipes to narrow down the options.

## MVP
Must include an admin portal to add recipes.

## Stretch
The recipe page will include buttons next to each ingredient the user didn't select, offering to switch the ingredient for either a close substitute or an alternative that still matches the flavour profile of the other ingredients.
